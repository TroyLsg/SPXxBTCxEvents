# SPXxBTCxEvents
My first project! Linking up the tick data of SPX &amp; BTC with some major events.

The HTML file is the visual graph of Bitcoin vs SPX vs Major events. I generated this graph to show how much more volatile Bitcoin is compared to the stock index. As well as colour coding some of the major events that are similar in nature to one another and how it affects the market in general.
